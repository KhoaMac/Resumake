            </div></section>
            <p>Your profile is the page you see when you are logged in. This is, unlike those from many social networking sites, private and only visible to you. The point of it being private is so that you can manage different resumes and ensure that companies only see what you want them to see.</p>
            <p>Here, you can perform trivial tasks such as selecting a profile picture or editing your personal information. If you have chosen a profile picture, companies will be able to see it. Editing your personal information allows part of your resume to be automatically filled in with information such as your email or where you live. This can save time in the long run and you can always edit each resume to display something different.</p>
            <p>The resume section that takes up the majority of your screen is where you can add, delete, and modify your resumes. You can create different resumes for different purposes and when our match-making functionality goes into effect, you can specify which resumes are visible for which searches.</p>

            <p>In your profile, click the "Add A Resume" button to go to the resumaker page. On this page is a form that, after filling out, will be used to automatically generate your resume webpage. The information will be broken up into different sections that pertain to the different parts of the resume</p>
            <p>As of now, there are six parts of your resume. Each is explained in more detail further down the page. Future releases may include custom sections or different templates for your resume.</p>

            </div></section>
            <p>An exciting new functionality that will be coming soon is the ability to generate your resume webpage simply by connecting to your LinkedIn profile.</p>
            <p>You will be able to, with a click of a button, import your profile so that all of the information you already have stored in your LinkedIn profile doesn't have to be entered in again. Further functionalities that will be released in later versions include importing via word documents. Eventually, you will be able to upload a word document and turn it into a webpage resume.</p>

            <p>The first part of the form consists of your basic information. This is where your name and other one-liners go.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The Resume field will be where the name of your resume goes (e.g. My Resume, Joe's Computer Science Resume, Resume #1). This is purely for your organization only as no one else will be able to see your resume title.</li>
            <li>The Name field (which should be automatically filled in for you) is where your name goes. You are free to change your name to anything you want, just understand that this is what anyone who looks at your resume will see first.</li>
            <li>The Position field is what you would introduce yourself as (e.g. Computer Science Engineer, Hobbyist, Free-Lance Painter, Environmentalist, Dragon-slayer). This should accurately summarize what you do and how you want to appear to the companies who view your resume.</li>
            <li>The Statement field is a short one to two sentences that clearly display your intent. This is where you explicitly say what you're looking for in a job (e.g. Seeking a part-time position as a software developer. or Interested in a full-time position in a research facility.)</li>

            <p>This part of the resume is where you list your contact information, if you filled out the personal information in your profile, the entire sections should be automatically filled in for you. You are, of course, free to change anything.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The Address field is your physical address. It should contain information such as your street and house/apartment number.</li>
            <li>The City field is the city or town you live in.</li>
            <li>The State field is for which state you live in. A user who does not live in the United States should leave it blank and place all the information in the address field.</li>

            <p>The Education part of the resume contains all the information regarding your education experience.</p>
            <p>In this section, you can add multiple schools to your education history by clicking the "Add Education" button. Upon clicking it, a window should appear where you can fill in all of the information for a school.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>The School field is the name of the school, institution, university or college that you attended. It should be clear enough so that anyone will be able to understand it (abbreviating it into two or three letters might not be a good idea here.)</li>
            <li>The Degree field is the degree that you earned or will earn at this school. Again, this should be fairly clear and indicative of what you have worked towards or what you are currently working towards.</li>
            <li>The Start Date field is the date that you started at this school. This should always be filled in even if you have not started here yet. If you have yet to start at this school, place the expected start date.</li>

            <p>The Skills part of the resume is where you list your any of your pertinent skills. Pertinent skills is a broad description that includes almost anything that will make a recruiter consider hiring you. Listing less-pertinent or irrevelant skills may be beneficial, but it might also clutter up your resume and make it harder for recruiters to spot the crucial skills.</p>
            <p>Skills are broken up into catgories so that you and the recruiter can view your skills in an organized and neat fashion.</p>
            <p>To add a category, click the "Add A Category" button. A window will appear where you will be able to enter in information related to the category which you are creating.</p>

            <li>To add a skill, click on the "Add A Skill" button. In the following fields that appear, fill in the name of your skill and a brief description of your skill. When you are ready to add your skill, click the "Add" button.</li>
